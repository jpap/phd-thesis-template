# Ph.D Thesis Template

This template, [created back in 2007](https://www.jpap.org/blog/2007/07/phd-thesis-template/), was designed for the University of Melbourne thesis guidelines at the time. Those guidelines may have since changed and you are encouraged to make changes to the template accordingly.  Pull requests are welcome!

Update 2017: Preliminary changes have been made to confirm the the 2017 [UoM policies](http://gradresearch.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/2027839/Preparation-of-GR-theses-rules.pdf), but require further work. 

Best wishes for your research and dissertation!
